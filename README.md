##  Key Activities & Tasks

### **Task 1: Text Summarization Tool**
- **Objective:** Developed a tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to summarize lengthy articles into concise text.
- **Libraries Used:** `transformers` (Hugging Face), `torch`
- **Technique:** Utilized the BART model (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) for abstractive summarization.

### **Task 2: Speech Recognition System**
- **Objective:** Built a system capable of transcribing speech from audio files into text.
- **Libraries Used:** `SpeechRecognition`, `pyaudio`
- **Technique:** Implemented the Google Web Speech API to process `.wav` audio files.

### **Task 3: Neural Style Transfer**
- **Objective:** Created a computer vision model that applies the artistic style of one image to the content of another.
- **Libraries Used:** `tensorflow`, `tensorflow_hub`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`
- **Technique:** Used a pre-trained Fast Style Transfer model from TensorFlow Hub.
- **OUTPUT**:

### **Task 4: Generative Text Model**
- **Objective:** Developed a text generation model capable of creating coherent paragraphs based on user prompts.
- **Libraries Used:** `transformers`, `torch`
- **Technique:** Implemented GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for causal language modeling.
